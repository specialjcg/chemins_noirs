# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing attack (Marvin Attack)
# - Severity: Medium (5.9/10)
# - Dependency chain: rsa 0.9.10 <- sqlx-mysql <- sqlx-macros-core <- sqlx-macros <- sqlx
# - Justification: This is a transitive dependency from sqlx-macros. We only use PostgreSQL
#   in production, not MySQL. The rsa crate is never executed in our code path.
# - Mitigation: PostgreSQL driver (sqlx-postgres) does not use MySQL-specific encryption.
# - Status: No upstream fix available. Will re-evaluate when sqlx 0.9+ is released.

# RUSTSEC-2023-0089: atomic-polyfill unmaintained
# - Dependency chain: atomic-polyfill <- heapless <- postcard
# - Justification: Low-risk unmaintained crate (not a security vulnerability).
#   Used only for binary serialization of DEM cache data (offline processing).
# - Mitigation: postcard is actively maintained and will likely migrate away from heapless.
# - Status: Monitoring. Will migrate to alternative serialization if needed.
# NOTE: Commented out to keep visibility in audit reports
